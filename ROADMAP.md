# VapiServe Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development for VapiServe, a Python library that provides out-of-the-box integrations for Vapi custom tools. The library aims to simplify connecting Vapi voice automation with popular services and APIs.

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

The current implementation includes:

- Core FastAPI webhook server implementation
- Grouped tools in the FastAPI Swagger UI
- Google Calendar integration (basic implementation)
- Base provider classes for multiple integration categories
- Skeleton code for several providers

- [ ] Workflow automation (chaining multiple tools)
- [ ] Integration with vector databases for context-aware responses
- [ ] Real-time data streaming for long-running processes
- [ ] Analytics and monitoring tools
- [ ] User interface for configuration and management

### Deployment and Infrastructure
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Terraform modules for cloud deployment
- [ ] Documentation site with interactive examples
- [ ] Advanced authentication and authorization
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota management

## Community and Ecosystem
- [ ] Contribution templates for new integrations
- [ ] Extension system for community-contributed providers
- [ ] Integration with other voice AI platforms
- [ ] Documentation and tutorials
- [ ] Community showcase and examples

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation will follow these principles:

1. **Modular Design**: Each integration category and provider will be implemented as separate modules with clear interfaces.

2. **Consistent APIs**: All providers within a category will implement the same interface (abstract base class).

3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality and progressively add more advanced features.

4. **Optional Dependencies**: Use extras in setup.py to make dependencies optional, reducing the installation footprint.

5. **Documentation-Driven**: Write documentation and examples before or alongside the implementation.

6. **Test Coverage**: Maintain high test coverage for all functionality, with mocked external services.

## Contributing to the Roadmap

This roadmap is a living document and we welcome community input. If you'd like to propose a new feature or integration:

1. Open an issue discussing the feature
2. Reference any relevant documentation or examples
3. Indicate if you're willing to contribute the implementation

## Release Schedule

- **v0.1.0**: Initial release with core functionality (Current)
- **v0.2.0**: Enhanced core and first wave of integrations (Q2 2024)
- **v0.3.0**: Second wave of integrations and improved tools (Q3 2024)
- **v1.0.0**: Stable API, comprehensive integrations, and advanced features (Q4 2024)

We'll adjust this schedule based on community feedback and contributions.
